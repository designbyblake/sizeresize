## Bugs fixed
The initial release was pushed too early and was release with bugs. This current release should fix the majority of those. However the code is not 100% complete so for now, feel free to use but know that there still may be some issues.

## Documentation and Examples Coming Soon
I hope to get documentation and examples complete by August 8th, 2016.

## To-do
* Write Unit Tests
* Write Documentation
* Create example code to show this in action
* Lint code
* Drink more coffee
